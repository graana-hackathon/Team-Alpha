GraanaHackathonServer:
This is the api for the search app developed in ASP.Net It Contains three sub projects.
1.Data
2.Core
3.Web

Web Project is the entry point of the api which will communicate with Core which contains the business logic and it will then call Data project to Commmunicate with the Database.
It is a layered Pattern Called Repository Pattern. We have used MSSQL as a database and used an Excel File as a basis for our data.  


## Front End

Front-End is made on react-native. In order to run the project you need to install the dependencies.

> 'npm install`

> `npx react-native run-android'

We have made an API but it is not on some live server so we used the API of team ASH(with their consent) just to show that everything is working fine.
